Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
    WPF Register Student is an application designed to create a way for students to be registered for upcoming courses. This includes registering for courses, said courses being worth 3 credit hours each, registering for no more than 3 courses or 9 credit hours, not being able to register for the same course more than once at a time, and verification of registered courses and enrollment.
    
What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
    The WPF Register Student application was designed to be user-centered and includes a clean UI that clearly guides the user with prompts if the registration is accepted, or why it was rejected. By following best practices and OOP objectives, this application should provide a reliable solution for student registration.
    
Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    The UI design was successful in creating an interface that is simple and consistent. The drop down menu for courses contains the available course numbers, and when registered they are displayed in a separate confirmation box. Any errors in the process should be identified and communicated via error messaging in the registration process to help guide the user. This should be a more user-centered application as it does not require the user to identify any code or enter any text commands that could be intimidating or confusing.
    
How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
    I first read through the source code and identified areas of code that were essential to overall function and areas that were essential to interaction. Identifying proper initialization, spelling errors, typos, and properly declared classes and modifiers. It is best practice to work on writing and editing code in small areas with frequent testing and debugging. One of the most important practices is to annotate notes and changes throughout the program, making it easier to pick up where one left off, or for another person to step in. These will be vital tools and skills for all future projects.
    
Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
    The most challenging aspect in this development process was learning to use Visual Studio and starting to understand C# as a programming language. Learning to use this program and being introduced to C# while working with existing code created a learning environment that was less stressful than trying to create something from a blank template. The console application allowed for editing in ways that would have taken much more time and thought in the other programming languages I have had experience with thus far.
